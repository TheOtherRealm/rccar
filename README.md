<p>We will primaraly be using the Build123D Python API ( <a href='https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html' title='Build123D'>https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</a> ) to create our models.  Although it may seem a little daunting at first glance, it allows you to create complex things quickly, and tweak parameters easily, once you get the hang of things.  And best of all, it's free and open source!</p>
